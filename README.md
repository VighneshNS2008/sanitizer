# Voice Controlled Contactless Hand Sanitizer Dispenser 
In this new normal we use sanitizer everyday. I have made a cheap sanitizer dispenser which is contactless and affordable.

SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLE INVOLVED
The voice assistant (Alexa) sends message to Blynk via IFTTT API to turn on the pump.

MATERIAL REQUIRED
The hardware required are 12v DC water pump, mini breadboard, Relay module and NodeMCU.
The Software used are Arduino IDE and Blynk.

PROCEDURE
This project uses Arduino, which is an open-source electronics platform. It is based on easy-to-use hardware and software. I have used NodeMCU and Blynk to turn the pump on and off.

WORKING
The voice assistant (Alexa) send message to IFTTT . IFTTT is a service which connects two apps called applets. The IFTTT then triggers the webhook to turn the switch in the Blynk app on. When the switch is on, the relay completes the circuit and the pump spray sanitizer on the userâ€™s hand.

UTILITY
The purpose of this project is to sanitize the hands without touching the things  like the bottle of sanitizer so that we can break the chain of virus by avoiding contact and maintain health, hygiene and cleanliness.
